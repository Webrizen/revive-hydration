# 💧 Revive Hydration 

*A gentle water reminder that doesn't ruin your flow*  

![Demo](https://placehold.co/800x400/e0f2fe/0369a1/png?text=Revive+Hydration+Demo)

## 🚀 Why This Exists
Because:
- You forget to drink water for 8 hours straight  
- Existing apps are either too naggy or too easy to ignore  
- Chrome Web Store fees are robbery ($5 might buy us coffee though)  

## ✨ Features
- ⏰ Custom reminder intervals (15min - 2hr)  
- 💤 Snooze button for when you're ~in the zone~  
- 🌙 Dark mode (because eyeballs matter)  
- 🔒 100% local - no data leaves your computer  

## 🛠️ Installation (It's Easy, Promise)
1. **[Download the .zip](https://revive-hydration.vercel.app/download)**  
2. Unzip it somewhere safe (like your `Documents` folder)  
3. In Chrome, go to `chrome://extensions`  
4. Toggle **Developer mode** ON (top-right)  
5. Click **Load unpacked** and select the unzipped folder  

⚠️ Chrome will show warnings - this is normal! [Why?](#faq)

## 🆘 FAQ
